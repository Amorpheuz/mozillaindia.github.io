				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello Mozillians,</p>
<p>Every year on January 28th, we celebrate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Privacy_Day">International Data Privacy Day</a>. This year also to celebrate the day we are staring with the <b>Privacy Month Campaign</b>. It is a community led initiative to make users and makers of the web learn, teach, care and share about <em>Online Privacy</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.mozillaindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Privacy-Month-cover.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1792 size-full" src="http://blog.mozillaindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Privacy-Month-cover.png" width="1181" height="437" srcset="http://blog.mozillaindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Privacy-Month-cover.png 1181w, http://blog.mozillaindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Privacy-Month-cover-252x93.png 252w, http://blog.mozillaindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Privacy-Month-cover-768x284.png 768w, http://blog.mozillaindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Privacy-Month-cover-600x222.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1181px) 100vw, 1181px" /></a></p>
<p>The aim of this campaign is to teach privacy basics and advanced dynamics to the web users and make them understand its importance via some fun activities and online posts. These posts are both informative as well as an interesting way to deliver the important message of Online Privacy and various infringements to it on the Internet today. Privacy Month is the first of many steps we’ll be taking this year in an effort to empower the users of the web to protect their privacy and control their digital footprint.</p>

<p>This campaign was originated by Mozilla India and is intended to be a global campaign. Communities from all over the world can participate. Please see below for the ways you can get involved. Volunteers are welcome to help with online posts, events, teaching kits and other resources like localization, and more.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="http://blog.mozillaindia.org/1646">success</a> of last year’s campaign, this year too has 2 parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Online</b>: 31 Teachable Moments. The goal of the online campaign is to provide a privacy tip a day that an average user could complete in 10 minutes or less. Tips will be shared through social media, such as Facebook and Twitter.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><b>Offline</b>: Host a Popup or community event/session/workshop to teach about privacy. The community will be hosting in-person privacy events throughout the month of January. This year, we hope this project goes global and include Mozilla community privacy events from around the world. You can help us by hosting online privacy focused events in your neighborhood, campus, school, city or region.</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>about: responsibility</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>June 22, 2008. I&#8217;m doing my MCA in Siliguri, studying on student loan. Saved up some cash to buy a decent camera. It was hard to commit to save up that much, but I really really wanted a camera since I was a child. The afternoon before I&#8217;m to actually buy the camera, I called up my dad to tell him about it (not that I&#8217;ll listen, if he says it&#8217;s a bad idea &#8211; I was determined).</p>
<p>My dad picked up the call, listened to me and said, &#8220;well, you&#8217;re 21 now, you make your choices. I was there to guide you, to prepare you to make the best choices in your life &#8211; I&#8217;d like to believe I did a decent job at it. If you let us know your decisions, we certainly appreciate that; but you don&#8217;t have to ask for permissions anymore&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a guy who gets into &#8220;deer in the headlights&#8221; situations often, but trust me, I was perplexed after the call. I wasn&#8217;t used to this&#8230; 99% Indian kids aren&#8217;t used to this. We don&#8217;t make our life choices. Our teachers tell us which college to get in, neighbors tell us which job to get and parents tell us which person to get married to. That works for us and if it doesn&#8217;t we can regret about it after few years, and tell our next generation what they should do to avoid it. Outsourcing responsibility to someone more experienced, and obey their orders, and having a good self-impression to them always has been our forte. But what is this?!?</p>
<p>I was so overwhelmed by the sudden trust/responsibilities put on me, that totally ate up my determination and spat out indecisiveness. I ended up not buying the camera.</p>
<hr />
<h3>about: retrospection</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back in 2011, when we started the new journey of Mozilla India, for what it is today&#8230; it wasn&#8217;t easy.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t the inauguration of Mozilla community in India; there were already handful few people involved in it and had their own way of operating an open source community. This is not a place to criticize them, nor is my intention, but we barely got active help/support from them.</p>
<p>We were criticized for every action we took, every events we hosted; for how childish we were and how we were destroying the community. We were soft-black-listed in their books and have never been appreciated for our initiatives. Many of us had to go through and ignore the passive-aggression coming our way from the folks, who ideally should be our seniors, mentoring and helping us at it.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we continued to make progress, and in 3 years we had probably the largest regional open source community in the world (I have no citation, please correct me if there has been a regional FOSS community more than a few thousand active contributor strong).</p>
<p>Were we too proactive and super hyped? Oh yes! Did we make mistakes? Oh hell, we did&#8230; truck loads of them. We learned from them, fixed it next time. Rinsed and repeated.</p>
<p><strong>The fear of making mistakes never held us back from trying something new; and at the end of the day, that was the key factor for the radical growth.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h3>about: reflection</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast forwarding to recent times, when many of these &#8220;us&#8221; are considering to be the new-old folks (or already have been), <strong>there&#8217;s a prominent void of the new-new folks</strong>. People who can take over, people who can be proactive and never hesitate to do something radical.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that we have been so much supportive of the activities, and hand-held the new community members, they&#8217;ve grown an inherent lean-on factors on these old folks; relying on them, expecting suggestions/permissions from them for every move they make.</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s the case, it&#8217;s cute and lovely&#8230; that this time on, the new members are getting the mentoring they deserve and subconsciously are relying on their informal mentors/hand-holders in the community. But at the same time, it&#8217;s possibly hindering the new members to step up and take over the responsibilities.</p>
<p>We lacked the guidance and appreciation, but we were proactive to make our own moves. It&#8217;s not about having the willingness to get something done, but actually going ahead and doing it.</p>
<p><strong>Now that we have the old-folks more than willing to support the newcomers, we don&#8217;t have enough pro-activeness from the newcomers (either out of respect or out of fear of making mistakes or both).</strong></p>
<hr />
<h3>about: restructure</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We often don&#8217;t realize how special we are, and how normal solutions aren&#8217;t as effective for us.</strong> We are the largest (again, correct me if I&#8217;m wrong) open source community on earth, trying to have an unified structure and governance. In no way we can operate on the same norms of most other regional communities, which are much less riddled with diversity of all sorts, and has much less constraints internally.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #666666;"><strong>Let me try and explain with a bad analogy&#8230; Windows/Mac vs Linux.</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #666666;">Windows is much more prone to security vulnerabilities, patching vulnerabilities are hectic service packs that are infrequent and require reboot/downtime and more&#8230; And Mac comes with choices already made for you, and defaults set for you, if you try to truly customize particular bits and pieces then&#8230; rats! But they give a decent personal user experience.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #666666;">On the other hand Linux didn&#8217;t look nice, in its early days, and wasn&#8217;t easy to get it working for a particular system, but by design it was most open to all sorts of possibilities and was much more robust. If you didn&#8217;t like the desktop environment, you can change it. And you can tinker with configs/drivers to make stuff work &#8211; often without even needing a reboot, and it has only gotten better.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #666666;">For a normal user, a Windows PC generally serves well. If you introduce them to Linux, their experience might not be as nice (partially for the being &#8220;used to&#8221; factor, but even apart from that).</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #666666;">But, for a server &#8211; a system that needs to be much more robust, has to be more consistent, has to scale up, has to have next to no downtime (and many more other parameters I&#8217;ll avoid listing) &#8211; shouldn&#8217;t you go with Linux?</span></p>
<p>Back to the point of how special we are&#8230; as a very (VERY) large community. There hasn&#8217;t been much of work or even research paper to learn from, what makes an open source community so large operate smoothly. I am not kidding.</p>
<p>So a couple of months back, when we designed the restructure guidelines for the community, we acted on giving it a Linux like architecture.</p>
<p>There has been many questions and many people are uncomfortable with the changes, or understanding them. It&#8217;s justified.</p>
<p>We focused way too hard to get it as close to a perfect prototype as it can be, but haven&#8217;t made it very easy for all to understand well. This blog post is an effort to bridge that gap &#8211; this is, &#8220;all that you need to know, to understand the restructuring of Mozilla India&#8221;.</p>
<hr />
<h3>about: recollect</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, to sum it up (like a movie with seemingly incoherent plots finally coming back together to make sense), for Mozilla India to be a continuously growing successful regional community:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>there needs to be autonomy at individual level</strong> (<em>be the change that you wish to see</em>)</li>
<li><strong>proactivity from members to take over responsibilities</strong> (<em>don&#8217;t wait for tasks given to you</em>)</li>
<li><strong>expect guidance from senior members, not their permission</strong> (<em>if you believe in something, do it</em>)</li>
<li><strong>take feedback, make corrections, document it, do better next time</strong> (<em>don&#8217;t feel discouraged, if criticized</em>)</li>
<li><strong>give feedback, try to help out, document and look out for peer activities</strong> (<em>it&#8217;s a community, not a competition</em>)</li>
<li><strong>if something needs a change, be the first to raise it</strong> (<em>the structure allows installing new drivers without needing a reboot ;</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I know this is not complete, comprehensive, most rigorous and perfect explanation of the restructure and the directions&#8230; but that&#8217;s because it&#8217;s not meant to be. This blog post is a shallow 3 feet pool to help you learn swimming. Once you&#8217;re ready for it, you can always go have the <a href="https://leanpub.com/mozillaindia-openbook">real coral-reef experience</a> (be sure to take scuba-diving gears with you).</p>

Activate Mozilla Community</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is up and close to catch up your attention!!<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://activate.mozilla.community/">Activate Mozilla Community</a> is a significant campaign with four focus initiatives. It supports the current organisational goals by enthusing someone on how he can start participating on the web and build web a better place to live. It also encourages mobilisation of one’s community by predominantly focusing on initiatives like development on Rust, WebVR, testing as well as non-technical initiatives like Maker Party, Policy and Advocacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4 Different topics to be assimilated with (Focused Initiative):</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Developer Engagement</li>
<li><i> Support the future Mozilla Web engine (coming soon)</i></li>
<li><i> Defend Internet Privacy and Policy (coming soon)</i></li>
<li>Use and Test Experimental Firefox Features</li>
</ol>
<h4>Developer Engagement</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers play a significant role in Mozilla. To facilitate their </span>functions and<span style="font-weight: 400;"> activities, we have developed certain add-ons. Few of those include some first-class developer tools in Firefox, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org">Mozilla Add-ons</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Developer Network</a>, a widely known developer documentation portal. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presently, as part of the developer engagement initiative, we have the following current activities to initiate.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Rust: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if you want to make web programming concise and secure? Rust is a system programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. We are looking forward to enrolling more developers for Rust. Rust is sure to make a better web environment and secure.<br />
</span>How can you start developing in Rust? Check out the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/">documentation of Rust</a> and signup on rust developer list as fast as you can.</li>
<li><b>Web Compatibility</b>: <span style="font-weight: 400;">Web Compatibility is an important issue to all those who look for a seamless running of all web content in all web browsers. The benefit of creating a compatible website lies in improving a website’s reach and minimises the loss of performance.</span></li>
</ol>
<h4>Use and test experimental Firefox features</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To increase the quality of the product and services, we have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to build and test them continuously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By testing new features and functionalities, we can help out to keep Firefox on the leading edge, and consumers are hooked on our product. You can assist us in this initiative by installing the <a href="https://testpilot.firefox.com/">test pilot</a> now and checking out the activity flow for the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can follow the available <a href="https://activate.mozilla.community/developer-engagement/rust-hack/">guidelines for Rust</a> and <a href="https://activate.mozilla.community/developer-engagement/webcompat-sprint/">Web compatibility activities</a> to know and understand the format, event flow and other resources. Make sure to write a blog after finishing any activity. </span>We have created a telegram group for a quick query, event discussion and reporting. <a href="https://telegram.me/joinchat/BGI7h0DV6QUw2kyyOKAfLg">Join the group</a>, or visit our <a href="https://activate.mozilla.community/faq/">FAQ section</a>. If you require budget and swag, then follow this <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/India/MozActivate">Wiki</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rust, a systems programming language which was started as a part-time side project in 2006 by Graydon Hoare is now supported by Mozilla Research for almost seven years now. Mozilla’s involvement came in 2009 once the language was fairly mature enough and could demonstrate its core concepts. Rust poses itself as an alternative to C++ by making system programming safer, providing better concurrency support and offer tractable features to parallel programming. Despite a long history of innovations and strategic decision changes in Mozilla, Rust’s core principles have remained constant. It focuses on three crucial necessities &#8211; <i>safety, speed</i> and <i>concurrency</i>.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.mozillaindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Rust_Logo.svg_.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1723 aligncenter" src="http://blog.mozillaindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Rust_Logo.svg_-252x252.png" alt="Rust_Logo.svg" width="252" height="252" srcset="http://blog.mozillaindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Rust_Logo.svg_-252x252.png 252w, http://blog.mozillaindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Rust_Logo.svg_-160x160.png 160w, http://blog.mozillaindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Rust_Logo.svg_-768x768.png 768w, http://blog.mozillaindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Rust_Logo.svg_-600x600.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px" /></a></p>
<p>Rust aims to offer an alternative to existing programming languages by providing a comfortable level of abstraction and by helping programmers write efficient code. To quote from the official <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/faq.html">FAQs</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Rust exists because other languages at this level of abstraction and efficiency are unsatisfactory.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Some notable applications written in Rust include <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">Servo</a>, Mozilla’s experimental browser engine and also a few components for Firefox. Apart from Mozilla, other tech giants like Samsung and Dropbox also use Rust for a variety of purposes. Samsung, a long-time supporter of the language contributed in building <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-joins-mozillas-quest-for-rust/">Android support</a> to the Rust compiler. Dropbox has been writing Rust components for almost two years now. Inspired by the popular sitcom <a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2016/06/lossless-compression-with-brotli/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2016/06/lossless-compression-with-brotli/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1469781980983000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGA-jlr-iS8sZxWQr-eFiVyq8-W-g">Silicon Valley</a>, they’ve written a faster Brotli decoder for lossless image compression using Rust which reduces the bandwidth being used by their customers.</p>
<p><b>Rust in India</b></p>
<p>Mozilla India’s association with Rust started way back in 2014 with <a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/ama/i-am-manish-goregaokar-gsocer-2014-in-mozilla-rust-servo-contributor-ask-me-anything/">Manish Goregaokar</a> contributing to Servo as part of the GSoC (Google Summer of Code) program. To start things off, Rust’s <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/galaxyk/albums/72157651031840283">stable release</a> (1.0) was celebrated at Mozilla Community Space, Bangalore on 25 March 2015 and was attended by various members of the community. The latest stable release of the language is 1.10, meaning 10 releases in just a short span of 18 months &#8211; indicating a six-weekly release cycle which ensures that new features and fixes land very quick.</p>
<div id="attachment_1724" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://blog.mozillaindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/18005554366_847c3734a8_z.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1724 size-large" src="http://blog.mozillaindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/18005554366_847c3734a8_z-600x286.jpg" alt="Mozilla Rust Release Meetup, Bangalore" width="600" height="286" srcset="http://blog.mozillaindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/18005554366_847c3734a8_z-600x286.jpg 600w, http://blog.mozillaindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/18005554366_847c3734a8_z-252x120.jpg 252w, http://blog.mozillaindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/18005554366_847c3734a8_z.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mozilla Rust Release Meetup, 2015, Bangalore</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Manish has been a continuous contributor to the language and now, is a member of the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/team.html">community team </a>as well as the moderation team of Rust. You know whom to get in touch with if you’d like to contribute!</p>
<p>Towards the end of 2015, we had another Mozillian, Jaipradeesh, from DoSelect initiate an innovative method to spike interest levels in Rust &#8211; an <a href="https://doselect.com/hackathon/doselect-rust-easy-hackathon">online coding challenge</a> using the language (the first of its kind) which helped developers get a taste of Rust’s syntax and style of coding. Rustaceans from all over the world took part in this challenge.</p>
<p>Fast forward to July 2016 &#8211; we have a <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/friends.html">bunch of organizations</a> using rust and a few <i>Rustaceans </i>(as they call themselves) presenting sessions and projects using the language at <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/rust-meetup-bangalore-july-2016-registration-25476470810"> Rust Meetup &#8211; Bangalore</a>, in early July. <a href="https://kaustavdm.in/">Kaustav</a>, a Mozillian and Rust user had organized this meetup to bring together the developer community interested in Rust here in Bangalore and possibly pave the way for new ones. This meetup provided an ideal platform for contributors of the language connect with the developers who use Rust for a variety of uses, and for those who had not yet heard of or used it, an opportunity to know it’s varied facets. It also gave insights into the Rust world for those who had yet to begin their journey, yet. Manish handled the introductory session on the syntax and semantics of Rust, followed by Kaustav who talked about Rustup, Cargo and cross compiling Rust programs. Later on, we had Rahul Sharma who is currently working on Servo as a G’SoC intern give an insight into contributing for the the project. This was followed by a few interesting demos by Rust users from different parts of the country. On the whole, the meetup provided a kick-start for anyone who wanted to learn more about Rust and eventually use the language in their projects. Interestingly, it also helped contributors to collect feedback from the people who use Rust in production.<br />
A <i>win-win</i> I must say!</p>
<p><b>How you can contribute</b></p>
<p>If this gets you interested to know more about Rust, here are a few opportunities to contribute.  Rust has a very active <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/community.html">community</a> that helps newbie contributors get up to speed and also moderate the development &amp; design of the language. A dedicated IRC channel #rust-beginners has been set up where beginners are welcome to post any queries they might have. There are a wide variety of <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/contribute.html">contribution opportunities</a> like bug triaging, documentation, building communities, building IDEs, writing code for libraries, etc.</p>
<p>With Mozilla deciding to <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/07/shipping-rust-in-firefox/">ship Rust in Firefox</a> and the community members engaging developers with informative sessions such as the ones above, I hope the community in India will be encouraged to make meaningful contributions to the language, it’s ecosystem and build amazing applications using Rust in the near future.</p>
<p>To the many Rustaceans still in the making, cheers!</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>PS: Thanks Kaustav for all your inputs!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A team of initiators joined to put forth the future into the present as a plan. A team of 25 members, selected gems from various sub-communities represented their crew by their presence in the Mozilla India Planning Meetup &#8211; 2016 at Pune on 09th &amp; 10th of July 2016. The team had also invited George Roter, Head of Core Contributors, Participation at Mozilla to support them in their journey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the energy being widespread the Day 1 had marked its beginning.</span></p>
<h2>Day 1</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspiration, the only thing which kindles the inner spirit of every human. The first session of the meetup was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stories of Self</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted by Haiyya. A well-organised presentation of one&#8217;s life, i.e., the experience we share can be the best rope of hope to all those who listen to it.<br />
</span></p>
<h3>Future vision of Mozilla</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Future goals of Mozilla were the theme of the next session.  The goals focus on five important areas </span></p>

</ol>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">1] Context Graph</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Context Graph is a recommendation system for the Web. Searching content in the search bar won’t just limit the results based on the browsing history but will also explore documents and links corresponding to the search, based on metadata of all web pages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Activity stream is the first Context Graph feature, currently available in <a href="https://testpilot.firefox.com/" target="_blank">Test Pilot</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It will evolve into a search engine which will also help the users to discover places on the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web, they have</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> never seen. It would be available for both desktop and mobile platforms.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">2] Future of Rust and Servo</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mozilla Research is supporting a new system programming language called Rust since 2009. This language concentrates on three crucial necessities &#8211; safety, speed and concurrency. Rust is one of the key focus areas, and it aims to provide a better platform for programmers in writing efficient codes with a comfortable level of abstraction.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Servo &#8211; the parallel browser engine project is under trial. It is a modern, high-performance engine designed for both application and embedded use. It is written in the new system programming language &#8211; Rust. This project aims to achieve better parallelism, security, modularity, and performance. To know more about Servo, check- </span><a href="https://servo.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://servo.org/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">3] Connected Devices</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mozilla wants to create open and accessible platforms that will allow individuals, businesses and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">others to benefit from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Internet of Things(IoT)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  IoT leads the way to the next phase of the Internet. The IoT ideas that align with Mozilla’s goals would be selected, and their problem statement and solutions would be worked on. Later, the prototypes of such statements would be built and would be tested in the market. Depending on the market response, the production of such devices would begin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the outcome of the overall process would be defining platforms.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">4] Mozilla’s Issue Agenda and Advocacy</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mozilla has identified five issues that must be tackled in the current era, to build an Open Internet:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open privacy and security</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open innovation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decentralization</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Web-literacy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital inclusion</span></li>
</ol>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mozilla Advocacy Engine:</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A global movement to build and protect the next wave of openness and opportunity online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The near-term goals are Online Privacy and Encryption whereas the mid-term goals are to increase the influence on issues like privacy, digital inclusion and web literacy.The long-term goals were set as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">behaviour</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> change and policy change. The impact of this will be providing conscious choice to build and protect Open Internet and launch of products, policies and laws in support of the Open Internet.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">5] Mozilla Leadership Network</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mozilla Leadership Network is a global network of diverse leaders who will ensure the next wave of access, inclusion and opportunity online. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It open practices to shape the Web in new ways and increase influence on privacy, digital inclusion and web literacy. It also supports to improve their skills and experience as leaders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thematic hubs to be focused are learning, science, internet policy and advocacy, women and web literacy, Internet of Things.</span></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">MLN audience:</span></h5>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Champion</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerging Leader</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young Leader</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This will generate a high impact on network alignment, network connectivity, network size, member influence and reach.</span></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discussion on community restructure was the next session.</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restructuring &#8211; the way to fill the gap.This session focused on bringing out the thoughts of participants regarding the structure of the Mozilla India community. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The participants</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were divided into groups and were asked to project their ideas about the structure of the community. The presentation by each team laid the first stone of change. With this brainstorming session, we got an overview, i.e., we paved the foundation.</span></p>
<h2>Day 2</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agenda for the second day focused on two topics, one related to a restructuring of the community structure and the other about the plan for the Meetup 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the foundation we created the day before, we were ready to lay the roads towards reformation.The attendees were divided into various groups and were asked to derive strategies around the following blocks:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Training and Workshops.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Conflict Resolution.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Team building and Recognition.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Planning and Community restructure.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Communication.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The motive of this session was to take into consideration a broader perspective about the functioning of the Mozilla India community and derive strategies around them. The restructuring process is a five weeks plan from 20th July to 21st August. Mozilla India has invited people to suggest the task force structure </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">via <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeH4Vq-iJuDj88T2Lk5vZrm6G7GOIFkRueKU3FitIbNk9Bi_A/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1" target="_blank">this link</a> before August.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following this, “the planning for the Mozilla India Meetup 2016”  was set to fire.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h5>MOZILLA INDIA MEETUP 2016<br />
Dates:   August 26th &#8211; 28th 2016.<br />
Title:   “Mozilla India Meetup 2016”</h5>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following points were listed as the goals for the meetup in August after the acceptance by all the participants.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop a strategy, direction and plan for the future of the community.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Re-structure the Mozilla India community &#8212; structures and processes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increase the leadership/mobilising skills of the attendees (and develop strong onboarding programs for new community members).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improve communication processes and tools, and transparency.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build strong teams.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build strong recognition practices.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create accountability systems and a code of conduct.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build a plan for increasing diversity and inclusive practice across the community.</span></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Team working marks its excellence only by the space given to everyone in the team.”</span></p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the heart of hearts, we believe that the Internet is the basic need of the hour and as a citizen of the 21st century, everyone must have access to the Internet. While we still have a literacy rate of 74.04% in the country </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and 77.08% in West Bengal, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">there are still a lot of people from various age groups have not used the Internet or do not know how to use it. The Initiative planned in such a way that we can reach out to a maximum number of people of all ages within a given time frame and teach them about the most potential resource of the world, the Web.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Kolkata being the only city in the country to go full wifi in next one year, many teenagers and kids will be using the Internet in near future. So, educating them about the Web is a necessity. Keeping this in mind, we came up with the One Web, an initiative to touch maximum lives in 3 months. The planning was driven by </span><a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/rano1396/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ranodeep Saha</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, along with Co-organizers </span><a href="https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/Technoayan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ayan Choudhury</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/u/shahidfarooqui/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shahid Ali Farooqui</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And the blueprint got ready in just seven days. The project finally got off to a flying start on 3rd of July, 2016.</span></p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/aotFObrs928?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A rain marred Sunday morning saw 23 volunteers engaging themselves to impart training on web literacy to some 153 underprivileged children at a southbound back alley near Topsia. It went on for 2 hours.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">‪ </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2nd event took place on 17th July 2016 at Kailash Vidyamandir near Chetla. Some 129 students participated with great enthusiasm. The idea is to hold one event on every alternate Sunday, for three consecutive months. So, just hold your breath!! There are a lot more in store to come up in next 6-7 Sundays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Special thanks to all our partners who supported the cause and stood by us.

<p>Hello Web is an initiative to take Mozilla’s aim of making the world web literate a step closer to reality. Mozillians went across India spreading the message of the necessity of being better Web citizens and providing internet connectivity to institutions. Web literacy sessions to teach people about the Internet and fundamentals of computers were held in various orphanages and educational institutions across India.</p>
<p>We had conducted Hello Web in December 2015. Then we went to various schools and coaching institutions to spread web literacy. Mozilla web literacy campaigns took place across five cities in India namely, Kolkata, Surat, Navi Mumbai, Jaipur and Rewa. This summer, we decided to do it differently because if you do not break new grounds and improve upon what you have done before, the job loses its value. When the idea of conducting sessions in orphanages was proposed, everybody agreed. We collaborated with <a href="http://www.hope-foundation.in/" target="_blank">The Hope Foundation</a>, Kolkata and requested them to permit us to conduct a web literacy campaign at orphanages. Hello Web was not intended to be a one-time session programme, the team wanted it to be the starting point of a long-term initiative. So, it was decided that campaigners would bring to the orphanage homes internet connectivity. If these children have access to the internet, they would be able to explore its benefits on their own as no theoretical explanation can be better than a practical experience. Mozilla Clubs have been set up in these places so that we can provide proper kits and teaching materials to those in charge. Volunteers could also monitor the progress of the children.</p>
<p>Shreenath, Ashun, Rayan, Debol, Sourath, Rohit, Kalyan, Tamoghna, Ayan, Farag who volunteered for Hello Web. We received invaluable support from our partners <a href="http://kolkatabloggers.com/" target="_blank">Kolkata Bloggers</a>, Mio Amore, <a href="http://sourcekart.com/" target="_blank">Sourcekart</a> and we are grateful to them for the same. A lot of young bloggers from the Kolkata Bloggers network, from different schools and colleges in the city who volunteered for the initiative, came up with blog posts on the events, on the importance of web literacy in general and on the impact the campaign has made on them. They have set an example that other youngsters are now keen to follow, leading to a better ecosystem which encourages an environment conducive for web learning. In short, Hello Web was nothing but an initiative to initiate a change we all wish to see.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://mozillafestival.org/" target="_blank">seventh-annual MozFest</a> will be held in London, from Friday, Oct. 28 &#8211; Sunday, Oct. 30.</p>
<p>This year, we&#8217;ll tinker with open software, hardware, and practices. We&#8217;ll share prototypes and ideas openly, so people from across organisations and industries can help them grow. We&#8217;ll examine how issues like Web literacy, online privacy and encryption are relevant across the globe, and address challenges faced by people who don&#8217;t yet feel they are welcome on the Web.</p>
<p>We will have nine Spaces &#8212; physical and thematic areas of learning based around a broad topic &#8212; delivering a variety of workshops, talks and sessions on a range of subjects including localization, copywriting law, diversity on the Internet, Internet of Things, Open Badges, Web literacy, and digital art and culture.</p>
<p>There are different ways to participate in the festival:</p>
<h4>Propose a Session</h4>
<p>Submit a session, workshop or demo that is hands-on, educational and encourages collaboration. Your creativity, expertise, and contribution to the open Web will not only benefit the Mozfest community, and it will enhance your leadership skills. Read more details and submit your session <a href="https://mozillafestival.org/proposals" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h4>Register for a ticket</h4>
<p>Join us at MozFest for the opportunity to meet, collaborate and work with developers, technologists, librarians, teachers, artists, journalists, scientists, open source enthusiasts and youth. We welcome anyone who is passionate, wants to learn more about the open Web and Web literacy. Register for a ticket <a href="https://mozillafestival.org/tickets" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
